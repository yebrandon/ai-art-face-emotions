# AI Art Face Emotions

This repo contains a script that will load a dataset of images generated by Stable Diffusion from [DiffusionDB](https://github.com/poloclub/diffusiondb), detect if each image contains a face, and, if it does, label the image with an emotion and save it. The emotions for each labelled image are saved to `results.csv`, and a tally of the results is saved to `results_summary.csv`.

An example of the program's results using the [DiffusionDB](https://github.com/poloclub/diffusiondb) `2m_random_50k` subset can be found in `example_results`.

## Usage

1. `pip install deepface datasets`
2. Follow the instructions to install the `face_recognition` library [here](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition#installation)
3. Configure `IMGS_DIR_PATH` and `SUBSET_NAME` to select the directory the images with faces detected will be saved to, and the DiffusionDB data subset to use, respectively. These values are set to `images/` and `2m_random_50k` by default.
4. `python main.py`

Be aware that with large datasets, the program can take a long time to execute and occupy a significant amount of space with the images saved.
